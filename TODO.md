# TODO list

## Behavioural bugs

* Ensure that object association is not lost when a Timer is fired for an object.

## Visual bugs

* Make the first frame draw correctly, without requiring a `return true` from the onStep event.

## Build process

* Add build-games.sh functionality (ie. SVG-to-PNG export) to gulpfile.

## Ideas

jQuery-like $ selector on scene objects (ie. @$) for selecting instances by name, coordinates, etc.
